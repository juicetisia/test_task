- Set VPC on free AWS account

- Set up DocumentDB 2+1 replica set (one for write and two for reading)

- Set ECR and pull our Node.js DB service from DockerHub (docker pull incodetech/ms-incode-database:staging_smile). For this I will need your Docker ID or email address registered with the DockerHub

- Create task definition for DB service with proper env variables. This is the list we use currently to properly run DB service

 

 {

          "name": "appname",

          "value": "DBL_DEMO_SMILE"

        },

        {

          "name": "mongohost",

          "value": “HOST_OF_YOUR_DOCUMENTDB"

        },

        {

          "name": "password",

          "value": “PASSWORD_OF_YOUR_DOCUMENTDB"

        },

        {

          "name": "replicaSet",

          "value": "rs0"

        },

        {

          "name": "ssl",

          "value": "true"

        },

        {

          "name": "user",

          "value": “USERNAME_OF_YOUR_DOCUMENTDB"

        }


- Create ECS that runs task definition together with proper LB and TG

- Set auto-scaling rules based on CPU and Memory (>75%)
